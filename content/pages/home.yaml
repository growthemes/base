      This is a basic demonstration that shows how to use Grow to build a few
      pages. What you see on this site is entirely controlled by the union of
      content files and template files. Content is kept separate from
      presentation. Some of the pages use YAML and partial templates, other
      pages just use Markdown. Try exploring.
